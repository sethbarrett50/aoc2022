# Advent of Code 2022

Welcome to my repository for the Advent of Code 2022 programming challenge. I have begun working on the challenges using Python, and hope to continue updating this repository with my solutions as I progress through the event.

So far, I have completed up to Day 10 of the challenge. However, I got tied up with finals and had to take a break. I hope to get back to it and finish the rest of the days in the near future.

I'll be sure to keep you updated on my progress and any further developments.
